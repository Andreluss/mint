# Modulo-Integer
This is a copy of an old project, very handy for competitive programming. 
The mint class can be used like a normal int thanks to the glorious function overloading in C++ :)
You can just 
1) set the mint::Mod to 1e9+7 for example 
2) and write very long, but still clear and readable arithmetic expressions without worrying about any overflows!
